# Configuration file for sending lunch email messages. This is set up to use
# simple username/password authentication where the password can be a normal
# password or an app password generated for Gmail. The program currently uses
# SMTP_SSL for the connection.

# If different authentication is needed then the program will have to be
# altered along with adding the appropriate configuration items in this file.
